Inside an Inn
You are standing inside an inn after a long day of slaying monsters. The glowing fireplace helping to light and warm the room. 
A trapdoor leads down to the basement where black market trades are made throughout the night. To your south a door leads out of the inn to the Town Square,
you hear the sound of laughter and drums through the door coming from the festival taking place there.

Many people are offering you gifts in return for your services as an adventurer.
